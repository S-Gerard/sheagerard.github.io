	<p>Swift is a mobile application for service sharing that allows users to quickly find services in their area and make money offering services to other users. 
		Transactions between users are processed through an escrow system, 
		and users can rate services. The app's design prioritized user needs, technical requirements, and business goals, with 
		emphasis on simplicity and trustworthiness. Registration requirements for becoming a Swifter are separate, with ID verification 
		and background checks, and a Swifter Dashboard was created to manage and complete services</p>

<h2 id="early-design">Early Design</h2>
<p>In the early stages of our design research, our team focused on identifying potential users of a service-sharing application and 
	determining the essential features they would require. Our objective was to investigate whether businesses would be interested 
	in a platform to advertise and manage their services or if the application would be more suited for individuals offering services 
	in their local community.</p>
<p>We started by asking ourselves if businesses would have a reason to use a third-party application to manage their work or if they 
	were content with their current methods. To gain insight, we sought to understand what features businesses would need to manage 
	their work more efficiently. Similarly, we explored how customers currently hire services, whether they prefer businesses or local 
	individuals, and if they would trust strangers from the community if they had a reliable service-sharing application with background 
	checks and verification.</p>
<p>To gather user feedback, we employed both interviews and questionnaires. Our interviews were open-ended and aimed at understanding 
	how users currently search for or offer services. We conducted three interviews, mainly with friends and family members. The 
	questionnaire was designed to reach a larger audience, and we analyzed statistics from multiple-choice and rating questions.</p>
<p>Our questions focused on the convenience of current service searching methods, satisfaction with current methods, preference for hiring businesses or 
	individuals, and what would be needed to trust individuals. For business owners and individuals offering services, we also inquired 
	about their satisfaction with current management methods and their willingness to use a third-party platform.</p>

<h3 id="key-insights">Key Insights</h3>

<h4><em>1. Trusting Strangers</em></h4>
	<div class="MuiGrid-root MuiGrid-container MuiGrid-spacing-xs-4 css-1tz8m30">
		<div class="MuiGrid-root MuiGrid-item MuiGrid-grid-md-6 css-gp0h3g">
			<p>We discovered that users were comfortable hiring people they did not know, provided they had undergone background checks 
				and had positive reviews. In fact, many preferred hiring local individuals over businesses. Since customers need to trust 
				the identity of individuals they hire, we decided to require that users offering services on the app will need to submit 
				their ID so that their name and date of birth can be verified. They also need to submit their social security number so 
				that a background check can be performed.</p>

	<div class="MuiGrid-root MuiGrid-item MuiGrid-grid-md-6 css-gp0h3g">
		<p>Businesses did not trust third party platforms to help them manage their services and were satisfied with their current methods of
			advertising and communicating with customers. Based on this discovery, we decided that the users offering services will likely be
			 individuals not operating under a business. Based on the interviews and questionnaires, there doesnâ€™t seem to be enough incentive
			  for businesses to host their services on third party platforms.</p>

<div class="MuiGrid-root MuiGrid-container MuiGrid-spacing-xs-4 css-1tz8m30">
<div class="MuiGrid-root MuiGrid-item MuiGrid-grid-md-6 css-gp0h3g">
<p>Our iterative design process mandated that we gather user feedback early and often throughout the design cycle. To accomplish this, 
	we utilized low-fidelity prototypes and engaged in a variety of design critiques (crits) with our classmates and instructor. During 
	these design critiques, our peers attempted to complete tasks on our prototype and we took notes on their feedback.
	Additionally, we conducted a heuristic evaluation with our peers to gain valuable insights into potential usability flaws and areas 
	for improvement.</p>
<p>Through our design crits and heuristic evaluations, we gained valuable insights into user behavior. We found that upon logging in, 
	many users were uncertain about the subsequent steps they needed to take. In addition, there was confusion surrounding how to become 
	a Swifter and start offering services once users had logged in. Even after successfully listing a service, users reported feeling 
	uncertain about the app's expectations for the service.  These affected changes to our designs in the following ways:</p>

<h4><em>1. Created a welcome page after creating an account that introduces you to the app.</em></h4>

<div class="MuiGrid-root MuiGrid-item MuiGrid-grid-md-6 css-gp0h3g">
<p>After gathering feedback and conducting a heuristic evaluation on our initial prototype attempts, we incorporated most of the 
	feedback as we refined our design into a high-fidelity prototype. During the early prototyping stages, we faced challenges with using Figma,

	tasks that users can perform on our app.</p>

<h3 id="resulting-design">Scenario 1:</h3>	
<p>You just graduated highschool and need to earn some extra money before college starts in the fall. Your dad bought a fancy riding lawn mower two

<!-- 	USER TESTING SECTION -->
<h2 id="user_testing">User Testing</h2>
<p>To conduct user testing on the Swift prototype, six participants with diverse backgrounds were recruited and four individual testing sessions 
	and one session with a pair of users was conducted. Each user was given a test script and a list of tasks to complete to ensure consistency in testing. 
	The Swift prototype was tested on a mobile device equipped with screen recording software and a laptop was used to record audio. Throughout the test, 
	the test monitor recorded notes on each tasks the user worked through in a data capture table. After completing the tasks, participants were asked to 
	fill out a post-study questionnaire to assess their comfortability using the app and to evaluate the app's overall usability. Additionally, open-ended 
	post-study interviews were conducted with each participant to gain deeper insights into their experience with the app. The questions included topics 
	such as what confused them while using the app, what they would like to see added, and which features of the app they found most helpful.By collecting data 
	from this user testing process, we were able to identify any usability issues and improve the overall design, functionality, and user experience of the app. </p>

<h3>Key Problems Identified</h3>
<h4><em>1. Availability calendar and date picker was confusing.</em></h4>
	<div class="MuiGrid-root MuiGrid-container MuiGrid-spacing-xs-4 css-1tz8m30">

		<div class="MuiGrid-root MuiGrid-item MuiGrid-grid-md-6 css-gp0h3g" style="width:65%;">
			<p>One main issue that was identified was the availability calendar and date picker on the booking request being confusing for users. 
				 A possible solution is to combine the interface that shows the Swifter's availability and the fields that allow a date and time 
				 to be selected. It should also be designed in a way that limits users to only booking the times available by the Swifter. 
				 The potential re- design shown instead allows users to scroll through dates and select the date they want to view. Once they 
				 do so they are shown time slots that are available. They can select the time slots they would like to book.</p>

	<h4><em>2. Unclear how to leave a rating and call support.</em></h4>

				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="MuiGrid-root MuiGrid-item MuiGrid-grid-md-6 css-gp0h3g" style="width:65%;">
			<p>It was apparent that many of the users were struggling with the task of leaving a rating for the Swifter. 
				The test notification that was meant to guide them to the rating page was not noticeable enough, causing a great deal of confusion and frustration 
				among the users. To address this issue, I decided to create a service summary page that would appear for a customer once a service had been completed. 
				The purpose of this page is to provide customers with a summary of the completed service, and to give them the option to rate the Swifter and call 
				support if needed. The rating and call support buttons are placed prominently on this page, making them more noticeable and easier to access.

			<p>Many users appeared to be unsure of the role of a Swifter and how they fit into Swift. To address this, I decided to create a more 
				engaging and visually appealing introduction to what a Swifter is and how they contribute to the app's purpose. While a brief explanation was 
				provided on the Swifter registration form, it did not seem to capture the users' attention or fully convey the value of being a Swifter. A more eye-catching and interactive 
				introduction would help users better understand the significance of their role and enhance their experience of becoming a Swifter.

				To do this I would create a page before the customer sign off page that is dedicated to giving the Swifter a chance to update the cost and attach 
				photos. Then they can move onto the step of getting the customer's signature. I also decided to add illustrations to add visual appeal and 
				help draw attention to the task that the Swifter needs to complete.

	<h2 id="final_reflection">Final Reflection</h2>
	<p>During my experience doing user testing, I encountered various challenges and gained valuable insights into the design and usability of the app. 
		One of the challenges was the limitations of the prototype, which resulted in delays and confusion for users. I also learned that users were more 
		likely to rely on prompts within the app rather than thoroughly reading the use cases, which was both helpful in identifying potential issues and led to missed tasks.
		I also discovered that users desired more instructions within the app but did not want to spend significant time reading lengthy explanations. 
		To address this, I incorporated illustrations into the app to provide visual cues and streamline the user experience. The testing session with a pair 
		 users was particularly insightful, as they were comfortable sharing their thoughts and helping each other through the tasks, leading to more feedback and ideas.
		Despite the challenges posed by the prototype limitations, users expressed enthusiasm for the app's purpose, and I believe that a fully functioning app 
		may have helped resolve some of the issues. Overall, my experience doing user testing was informative and allowed me to improve the design and functionality 
		of the app.</p>
